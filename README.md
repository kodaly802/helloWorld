# helloWorld
This is my first repository &amp; is a noobie reference &amp; junk.

Hallo, I am here trying to learn coding/programming because it's awesome and hella useful. I'm not sure which language to learn yet, but python or a mix of html/css/JavaScript are the two I feel I could do stuff with first. :P
